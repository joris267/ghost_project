The game screen will contain a status bar at the top with the name and an options button (button A)
Pressing it will bring down the options menu that I'll explain bellow.

In text field B the current word en the score is presented and dynamically updated.
In text field C the name of the current player is shown.
Below the text fields their is a keyboard  for putting in a letter.
After entering a single letter the keyboard will disappear and an confirmation screen will appear.

Here the resulting word is shown and their are two buttons, one to confirm and one to go back to enter another letter.
After confirmation their are two options. If the player has lost the game progresses to the win screen. 
Otherwise the game goes back to the main screen and the other player is.


In the options menu the players have the options to change their names in input fields A.
Spinner B will allow them to change the language. If the language is changed a pop up message will appear to confirm the decision.
If confirmed the game will start over with the new language.
Button C will also create a confirmation prompt. If confirmed the game will start over.
